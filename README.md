## User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner 
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule 
WHEN I open the planner 
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 
WHEN I scroll down 
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours 
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day 
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future 
WHEN I click into a time block 
THEN I can enter an event 
WHEN I click the save button for that time block 
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage 
WHEN I refresh the page 
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Challenges
One challenge I had with this project was linking the project to GitHub. I worked with a tutor for an hour, we couldn't fix it, then I made a new repository and the problem was fixed in two minutes.

I also struggled with finding out the right format to set this project up. I tried a few different ways until I decided to use individual timeblocks in the HTML.
